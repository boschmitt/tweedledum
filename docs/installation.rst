Installation
============

tweedledum is a header-only C++-17 library. Just add the include directory of tweeldedum to your
include directories, and you can integrate it into your source files using

.. code-block:: c++

  #include <tweedledum/tweedledum.hpp>

Alpha Disclaimer
----------------

**tweedledum is in version Alpha**. Hence, the software is still under active development and not
feature complete, meaning the API is subject to big changes. This is released for developers or
users who are comfortable living on the absolute bleeding edge.

Requirements
------------

We tested building tweedledum on Mac OS and Linux using:

* Clang 6.0.0
* Clang 7.0.0
* GCC 7.3.0
* GCC 8.1.0.

If you experience that the system compiler does not suffice the requirements, you can manually
pass a compiler to CMake using::

  cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/c++-compiler ..

Building the examples
---------------------

The included `CMake build script` can be used to build the tweedledum library examples on a wide
range of platforms. CMake is freely available for download from http://www.cmake.org/download/.

CMake works by generating native makefiles or project files that can be used in the compiler
environment of your choice. The typical workflow starts with::

  mkdir build      # Create a directory to hold the build output.
  cd build

To build the `examples` set the ``TWEEDLEDUM_EXAMPLES`` CMake variable to ``TRUE``::

  cmake -DTWEEDLEDUM_EXAMPLES=TRUE <path/to/tweedledum>

where :file:`{<path/to/tweedledum>}` is a path to the ``tweedledum`` repository. 

If you are on a \*nix system, you should now see a Makefile in the current directory. Now you can
build the library by running :command:`make`.

All :file:`*.cpp` files in the :file:`{examples/}` directory will be compiled to its own executable
which will have the same name. For example, the file :file:`examples/hello_world.cpp` will generate
the executable :file:`hello_world`.

Once the examples have been built you can invoke :command:`./examples/<name>` to run it::

  ./examples/hello_world


Building the documentation
--------------------------

To build the documentation you need the following software installed on your system:

* `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ with pip and virtualenv
* `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_

First generate makefiles or project files using CMake as described in the previous section.
Then compile the ``doc`` target/project, for example::

  make doc

This will generate the HTML documentation in ``doc/html``.
