Basic tools (containers, algorithms) used by other quantstack packages

## Installation

`xtl` is a header-only library. We provide a package for the conda package manager.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge xtl
```

Or you can directly install it from the sources:

```bash
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=your_install_prefix
make install
```

## Documentation

To get started with using `xtl`, check out the full documentation

http://xtl.readthedocs.io/


## Building the HTML documentation

xtl's documentation is built with three tools

 - [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org)
 - [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org)
 - [breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io)

While doxygen must be installed separately, you can install breathe by typing

```bash
pip install breathe
```

Breathe can also be installed with `conda`

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge breathe
```

Finally, build the documentation with

```bash
make html
```

from the `docs` subdirectory.
