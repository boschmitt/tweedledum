    "In this tutorial we will go from knowing nothing about `tweedledum` to understanding its underlying conpcepts. Note that this is not a quantum computing 101 tutorial, I assume familiarity of quantum computing.\n",

    "As you know, the most commonly used notation for representing quantum algorithms is the quantum circuit model introduced by Deutsch. The model describes the computation as a sequence of elementary quantum gates acting on a collection of qubits.  In tweedledum, the representation of quantum programs is a __quantum circuit__, hereinafter called __circuit__. \n",

    "At the very bottom of the layers of abstraction rest concepts of quantum bit, __qubit__, and classical bit, __cbit__ (or just bit). I expect the reader to be familiar with those. So I will start describing the wires.\n",

    "A wire can be either a quantum or classical. A quantum wire holds the state of a qubit, and it is represented by a line in quantum circuit diagrams. In tweedledum, a quantum wire is equivalent to a qubit. Similarly, a classical wire holds the state of a cbit, and it is represented by a double line in quantum circuit diagrams."
