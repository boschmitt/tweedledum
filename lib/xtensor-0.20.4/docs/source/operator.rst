Operators and functions
=======================

Arithmetic operators
--------------------

`xtensor` provides overloads of traditional arithmetic operators for
``xexpression`` objects:

- unary ``operator+``
- unary ``operator-``
- ``operator+``
- ``operator-``
- ``operator*``
- ``operator/``
- ``operator%``

All these operators are element-wise operators and apply the lazy broadcasting
rules explained in a previous section.

.. code::

    #incude "xtensor/xarray.hpp"

    xt::xarray<int> a = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
    xt::xarray<int> b = {1, 2};

    xt::xarray<int> res = 2 * (a + b);
    // => res = {{4, 8}, {8, 12}}

Logical operators
-----------------

`xtensor` also provides overloads of the logical operators:

- ``operator!``
- ``operator||``
- ``operator&&``

Like arithmetic operators, these logical operators are element-wise operators
and apply the lazy broadcasting rules. In addition to these element-wise
logical operators, `xtensor` provides two reducing boolean functions:

- ``any(E&& e)`` returns ``true`` if any of ``e`` elements is truthy, ``false`` otherwise.
- ``all(E&& e)`` returns ``true`` if all elements of ``e`` are truthy, ``false`` otherwise.

and an element-wise ternary function (similar to the ``: ?`` ternary operator):

- ``where(E&& b, E1&& e&, E2&& e2)`` returns an ``xexpression`` whose elements
  are those of ``e1`` when corresponding elements of ``b`` are thruthy, and
  those of ``e2`` otherwise.

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"

    xt::xarray<bool> b = { false, true, true, false };
    xt::xarray<int> a1 = { 1,   2,  3,  4 };
    xt::xarray<int> a2 = { 11, 12, 13, 14 };

    xt::xarray<int> res = xt::where(b, a1, a2);
    // => res = { 11, 2, 3, 14 }

Unlike in ``numpy.where``, ``xt::where`` takes full advantage of the lazyness
of `xtensor`.

Comparison operators
--------------------

`xtensor` provides overloads of the inequality operators:

- ``operator<``
- ``operator<=``
- ``operator>``
- ``operator>=``

These overloads of inequality operators are quite different from the standard
C++ inequality operators: they are element-wise operators returning boolean
``xexpression``:

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"

    xt::xarray<int> a1 = {  1, 12,  3, 14 };
    xt::xarray<int> a2 = { 11,  2, 13, 4  };
    xt::xarray<bool> comp = a1 < a2;
    // => comp = { true, false, true, false }

However, equality operators are similar to the traditional ones in C++:

- ``operator==(const E1& e1, const E2& e2)`` returns ``true`` if ``e1`` and ``e2`` hold the same elements.
- ``operator!=(const E1& e1, const E2& e2)`` returns ``true`` if ``e1`` and ``e2`` don't hold the same elements.

Element-wise equality comparison can be achieved through the ``xt::equal``
function.

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"

    xt::xarray<int> a1 = {  1,  2, 3, 4};
    xt::xarray<int> a2 = { 11, 12, 3, 4};

    bool res = (a1 == a2);
    // => res = false

    xt::xarray<bool> re = xt::equal(a1, a2);
    // => re = { false, false, true, true }

Bitwise operators
-----------------

`xtensor` also contains the following bitwise operators:

- Bitwise and: ``operator&``
- Bitwise or: ``operator|``
- Bitwise xor: ``operator^``
- Bitwise not: ``operator~``
- Bitwise left/right shift: ``left_shift``, ``right_shift``

Mathematical functions
----------------------

`xtensor` provides overloads for many of the standard mathematical functions:

- basic functions: ``abs``, ``remainder``, ``fma``, ...
- exponential functions: ``exp``, ``expm1``, ``log``, ``log1p``, ...
- power functions: ``pow``, ``sqrt``, ``cbrt``, ...
- trigonometric functions: ``sin``, ``cos``, ``tan``, ...
- hyperbolic functions: ``sinh``, ``cosh``, ``tanh``, ...
- Error and gamma functions: ``erf``, ``erfc``, ``tgamma``, ``lgamma``, ....
- Nearest integer floating point operations: ``ceil``, ``floor``, ``trunc``, ...

See the API reference for a comprehensive list of available functions. Like
operators, the mathematical functions are element-wise functions and apply the
lazy broadcasting rules.

Casting
-------

`xtensor` will implicitly promote and/or cast tensor expression elements as
needed, which suffices for most use-cases. But explicit casting can be
performed via ``cast``, which performs an element-wise ``static_cast``.

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"

    xt::xarray<int> a = { 3, 5, 7 };

    auto res = a / 2;
    // => res = { 1, 2, 3 }

    auto res2 = xt::cast<double>(a) / 2;
    // => res2 = { 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 }

Reducers
--------

`xtensor` provides reducers, that is, means for accumulating values of tensor
expressions over prescribed axes. The return value of a reducer is an
``xexpression`` with the same shape as the input expression, with the specified
axes removed.

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"
    #include "xtensor/xmath.hpp"

    xt::xarray<double> a = xt::ones<double>({3, 2, 4, 6, 5});
    xt::xarray<double> res = xt::sum(a, {1, 3});
    // => res.shape() = { 3, 4, 5 };
    // => res(0, 0, 0) = 12

You can also call the ``reduce`` generator with your own reducing function:

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"
    #include "xtensor/xreducer.hpp"

    xt::xarray<double> arr = some_init_function({3, 2, 4, 6, 5});
    xt::xarray<double> res = xt::reduce([](double a, double b) { return a*a + b*b; },
                                        arr,
                                        {1, 3});

The reduce generator also accepts a ``xreducer_functors`` object, a tuple of three functions
(one for reducing, one for initialization and one for merging). A generator is provided to
build the ``xreducer_functors`` object, the last function can be omitted:

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"
    #include "xtensor/xreducer.hpp"

    xt::xarray<double> arr = some_init_function({3, 2, 4, 6, 5});
    xt::xarray<double> res = xt::reduce(xt::make_xreducer_functor([](double a, double b) { return a*a + b*b; },
                                                                  [](double a) { return a * 2; })
                                        arr,
                                        {1, 3});


Accumulators
------------

Similar to reducers, `xtensor` provides accumulators which are used to
implement cumulative functions such as ``cumsum`` or ``cumprod``. Accumulators
can currently only work on a single axis. Additionally, the accumulators are
not lazy and do not return an xexpression, but rather an evaluated ``xarray``
or ``xtensor``.

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"
    #include "xtensor/xmath.hpp"

    xt::xarray<double> a = xt::ones<double>({5, 8, 3});
    xt::xarray<double> res = xt::cumsum(a, 1);
    // => res.shape() = {5, 8, 3};
    // => res(0, 0, 0) = 1
    // => res(0, 7, 0) = 8

You can also call the ``accumumulate`` generator with your own accumulating
function. For example, the implementation of cumsum is as follows:

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"
    #include "xtensor/xaccumulator.hpp"

    xt::xarray<double> arr = some_init_function({5, 5, 5});
    xt::xarray<double> res = xt::accumulate([](double a, double b) { return a + b; },
                                            arr,
                                            1);

Evaluation strategy
-------------------

Generally, `xtensor` implements a :ref:`lazy execution model <lazy-evaluation>`,
but under certain circumstances, a *greedy* execution model with immediate
execution can be favorable. For example, reusing (and recomputing) the same
values of a reducer over and over again if you use them in a loop can cost a
lot of CPU cycles. Additionally, *greedy* execution can benefit from SIMD
acceleration over reduction axes and is faster when the entire result needs to
be computed.

Therefore, xtensor allows to select an ``evaluation_strategy``. Currently, two
evaluation strategies are implemented: ``evaluation_strategy::immediate`` and
``evaluation_strategy::lazy``. When ``immediate`` evaluation is selected, the
return value is not an xexpression, but an in-memory datastructure such as a
xarray or xtensor (depending on the input values).

Choosing an evaluation_strategy is straightforward. For reducers:

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"
    #include "xtensor/xreducer.hpp"

    xt::xarray<double> a = xt::ones<double>({3, 2, 4, 6, 5});
    auto res = xt::sum(a, {1, 3}, xt::evaluation_strategy::immediate());
    // or select the default:
    // auto res = xt::sum(a, {1, 3}, xt::evaluation_strategy::lazy());

Note: for accumulators, only the ``immediate`` evaluation strategy is currently
implemented.

Universal functions and vectorization
-------------------------------------

`xtensor` provides utilities to **vectorize any scalar function** (taking
multiple scalar arguments) into a function that will perform on
``xexpression`` s, applying the lazy broadcasting rules which we described in a
previous section. These functions are called ``xfunction`` s. They are
`xtensor`'s counterpart to numpy's universal functions.

Actually, all arithmetic and logical operators, inequality operator and
mathematical functions we described before are ``xfunction`` s.

The following snippet shows how to vectorize a scalar function taking two
arguments:

.. code::

    #include "xtensor/xarray.hpp"
    #include "xtensor/xvectorize.hpp"

    int f(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + 2 * b;
    }

    auto vecf = xt::vectorize(f);
    xt::xarray<int> a = { 11, 12, 13 };
    xt::xarray<int> b = {  1,  2,  3 };
    xt::xarray<int> res = vecf(a, b);
    // => res = { 13, 16, 19 }
